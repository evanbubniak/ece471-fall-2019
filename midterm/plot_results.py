# Plot of learning curves
# all dots have black outline
#true labels: blue, with blue square dots

# random labels - red, with red circular dots

# shuffled pixels: green, with green star 5-point star dots

# random pixels: purple, with no dots

# gaussian: black, with black diamond dots

# x-label: thousand steps (steps of 5, from 0 to 25)
# y-label: average_loss (steps of 0.5, from 0 to 2.5)
# dots evenly spaced along x axis, with about 1.3 dots per training step, starting at about 0.5
